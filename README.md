# About
This was a school project where I needed to copy a pcb design and redesign it in altium.

# Info
If you want to copy this design feel free to do so but I have never tested it because 1 of the elektronics was miss placed in the design, it was placed horizontal. This is easily fixed by replacing the electronic with a vertical version of the same elektronic. It was called K12 in the design.
